<p> Description: This graph shows the number of Palestinian people left homeless as a result of Israeli home demolitons for the purpose of punishment. Benefits of Graph: "Spikes" in total people left homeless due to demolitions can be easily identified. It can also be used to visually represent the number of people left homeless between two unique events. It can also be used to track ebbs and flows in demolition trends over time. Limitations: This graph does not display the sum of total people left homeless on a single date. Also, the graph does not include a spatial component. i.e. it does not display locality data which would make for a more comprehensive understanding of trends in Israeli home demolitions as punishment. </p>
